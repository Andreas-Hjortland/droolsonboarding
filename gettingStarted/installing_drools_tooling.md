# Installing Drools Tooling

We propose a VirtualBox Virtual Machine with all installed and configured.

If you prefer, you can install all tools on your machine.
To be able to work with drools, we need : 
1) Java Virtual machine version 8
2) Eclipse IDE
3) download drools runtime and tools

##Install Java Virtual Machine
Drools is working with either Oracle Java machine or OpenJDK. With the drools version we have, we can have java version 7 or 8.
##Install Eclipse IDE
After installing java, we can install [eclise](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/mars2).

##Download drools tooling
To be able to use drools in eclipse, we need to download the [Drools and jbpm Tools](http://download.jboss.org/drools/release/6.4.0.Final/droolsjbpm-tools-distribution-6.4.0.Final.zip).

You have to unzip the file. In the directory droolsjbpm-tools-distribution-6.4.0.Final/binaries/org.drools.updatesite/ is the update site from where you have to install new Software.
