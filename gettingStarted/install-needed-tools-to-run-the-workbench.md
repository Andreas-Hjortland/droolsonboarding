To be able to run the workbench as well as the kie server nativelely on your machine, a lot has to be installed :

* Java runtime
* Bundle that installs all needed component

Then you run a shell script to make all run. What if you have another version of java ?

To make it easier, we are going to use a container technology called[ docker.](https://www.docker.com)

This technology allows us to use pre-build images that run on all supported platform of docker : nearly all linux flavors, Mac Os and windows and this in native way for [windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) or for [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).  You can use this way of using but we shall use the toolbox instead.

This will avoid spolling your operating system, we are going to use virtual machines on your host.

For the windows\/MacOS machines, the toolbox is [here.](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
