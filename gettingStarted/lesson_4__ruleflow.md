# Organizing rule execution for bigger projects

## Why do we need a Ruleflow ?
When capturing business requirements, most users express the rules by dividing the problem to resolve in steps. As this, it is very convenient to be able to implement it the same way. 
In the drools/jbpm technology, we are going to use a jbpm process by using rule steps, it is then called a rule flow. But in reality, we can mix jbpm/drools together.
