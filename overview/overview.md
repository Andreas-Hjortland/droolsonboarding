# Overview




Software programmers are used to a procedural approach when it comes to implement Business requirements.

- old principle
- one of the algorithm used (Rete) was published in 1983
- follow up of oriented object concept
- main focus should not be done on the tooling but on the concept shift : procedural to declarative programming. But most article focus on the tooling.
- the first set of tutorials called "drools tutorials" start from the base concepts (there are few and is concentrated on the the core engine) up to more language concepts
- the second set of tutorials called  "BRMS tutorial" will introduce the the management tooling (called workbench)  around the lifecycle of the rule artifact. but the workbench also introduces more artifacts type like decision table, rule templates, etc.. that will help when modeling business requirements.
- the third set of tutorials called "BRMS runtime tutorials" start to introduce possible software architectures that we can
